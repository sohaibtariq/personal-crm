# Create Classification Request

## Structure

`CreateClassificationRequest`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Model` | `string` | Required | ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them. |
| `Query` | `string` | Required | Query to be classified.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1` |
| `Examples` | `List<List<string>>` | Optional | A list of examples with labels, in the following format:<br><br>`[["The movie is so interesting.", "Positive"], ["It is quite boring.", "Negative"], ...]`<br><br>All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.<br><br>You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Items*: `2`, *Maximum Items*: `200`, *Minimum Length*: `1` |
| `File` | `string` | Optional | The ID of the uploaded file that contains training examples. See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file of the desired format and purpose.<br><br>You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both. |
| `Labels` | `List<string>` | Optional | The set of categories being classified. If not specified, candidate labels will be automatically collected from the examples you provide. All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Items*: `2`, *Maximum Items*: `200` |
| `SearchModel` | `string` | Optional | ID of the model to use for [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create). You can select one of `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, or `davinci`.<br>**Default**: `"ada"` |
| `Temperature` | `double?` | Optional | What sampling `temperature` to use. Higher values mean the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer.<br>**Default**: `0`<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 2` |
| `Logprobs` | `int?` | Optional | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.<br><br>The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. If you need more than this, please contact support@openai.com and describe your use case.<br><br>When `logprobs` is set, `completion` will be automatically added into `expand` to get the logprobs.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 5` |
| `MaxExamples` | `int?` | Optional | The maximum number of examples to be ranked by [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create) when using `file`. Setting it to a higher value leads to improved accuracy but with increased latency and cost.<br>**Default**: `200` |
| `LogitBias` | `object` | Optional | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.<br><br>Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.<br><br>As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <\|endoftext\|> token from being generated. |
| `ReturnPrompt` | `bool?` | Optional | If set to `true`, the returned JSON will include a "prompt" field containing the final prompt that was used to request a completion. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.<br>**Default**: `false` |
| `ReturnMetadata` | `bool?` | Optional | A special boolean flag for showing metadata. If set to `true`, each document entry in the returned JSON will contain a "metadata" field.<br><br>This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.<br>**Default**: `false` |
| `Expand` | `object` | Optional | If an object name is in the list, we provide the full information of the object; otherwise, we only provide the object ID. Currently we support `completion` and `file` objects for expansion. |
| `User` | `string` | Optional | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which will help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. |

## Example (as JSON)

```json
{
  "model": null,
  "query": "The plot is not very attractive."
}
