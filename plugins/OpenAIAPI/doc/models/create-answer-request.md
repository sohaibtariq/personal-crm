## Structure

`CreateAnswerRequest`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Model` | `string` | Required | ID of the model to use for completion. You can select one of `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, or `davinci`. |
| `Question` | `string` | Required | Question to get answered.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1` |
| `Examples` | `List<List<string>>` | Required | List of (question, answer) pairs that will help steer the model towards the tone and answer format you'd like. We recommend adding 2 to 3 examples.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Items*: `1`, *Maximum Items*: `200`, *Minimum Length*: `1` |
| `ExamplesContext` | `string` | Required | A text snippet containing the contextual information used to generate the answers for the `examples` you provide. |
| `Documents` | `List<string>` | Optional | List of documents from which the answer for the input `question` should be derived. If this is an empty list, the question will be answered based on the question-answer examples.<br><br>You should specify either `documents` or a `file`, but not both.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Items*: `200` |
| `File` | `string` | Optional | The ID of an uploaded file that contains documents to search over. See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file of the desired format and purpose.<br><br>You should specify either `documents` or a `file`, but not both. |
| `SearchModel` | `string` | Optional | ID of the model to use for [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create). You can select one of `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, or `davinci`.<br>**Default**: `"ada"` |
| `MaxRerank` | `int?` | Optional | The maximum number of documents to be ranked by [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create) when using `file`. Setting it to a higher value leads to improved accuracy but with increased latency and cost.<br>**Default**: `200` |
| `Temperature` | `double?` | Optional | What [sampling temperature](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277) to use. Higher values mean the model will take more risks and value 0 (argmax sampling) works better for scenarios with a well-defined answer.<br>**Default**: `0` |
| `Logprobs` | `int?` | Optional | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.<br><br>The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. If you need more than this, please contact support@openai.com and describe your use case.<br><br>When `logprobs` is set, `completion` will be automatically added into `expand` to get the logprobs.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 5` |
| `MaxTokens` | `int?` | Optional | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer<br>**Default**: `16` |
| `Stop` | `string` | Optional | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence. |
| `N` | `int?` | Optional | How many answers to generate for each question.<br>**Default**: `1`<br>**Constraints**: `>= 1`, `<= 10` |
| `LogitBias` | `object` | Optional | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.<br><br>Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.<br><br>As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <\|endoftext\|> token from being generated. |
| `ReturnMetadata` | `bool?` | Optional | A special boolean flag for showing metadata. If set to `true`, each document entry in the returned JSON will contain a "metadata" field.<br><br>This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.<br>**Default**: `false` |
| `ReturnPrompt` | `bool?` | Optional | If set to `true`, the returned JSON will include a "prompt" field containing the final prompt that was used to request a completion. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.<br>**Default**: `false` |
| `Expand` | `object` | Optional | If an object name is in the list, we provide the full information of the object; otherwise, we only provide the object ID. Currently we support `completion` and `file` objects for expansion. |
| `User` | `string` | Optional | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which will help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. |

  "examples": [
    [
      "What is the capital of Canada?",

    ],
    [
      "Which province is Ottawa in?",
      "Ontario"
    ]
  ],
  "examples_context": "Ottawa, Canada's capital, is located in the east of southern Ontario, near the city of Montr√©al and the U.S. border."
}
